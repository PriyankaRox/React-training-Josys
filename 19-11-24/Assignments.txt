1.  Recreate the Context API example(that we discussed in the session) using Class components in React with TypeScript?
	 -->  Prepare short notes on context api in class components. 
	 
2.  Implement the following requirement using HOC concept:
			a.  Create a HOC that takes url, dataProperties as properties
			b.  HOC should generate the grid (table format)  with the data return by the url.
			c.   dataProperties  help us to iterate the columns in table 
			d.   HOC returns the component that display data. 
			
			gridHoc ---  urls:string,  dataProperties: string[]
