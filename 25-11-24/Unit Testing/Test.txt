Unit testing is the process of testing individual units or components of a software 
application in isolation to ensure they function correctly. A "unit" typically refers 
to the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class. 
The goal is to verify that each unit performs as expected under various conditions.

Why Do We Write Unit Tests?
Detect Bugs Early: Unit tests help identify bugs in the code during the development phase, 
reducing the cost of fixing them later.

Ensure Code Quality: They validate that the code meets functional requirements and behaves 
as expected.

Enable Refactoring: With robust unit tests in place, developers can confidently refactor or 
modify code without fear of introducing new bugs.

Promote Reliable Code: Unit tests act as documentation for the behavior of individual 
components, making it easier for teams to understand and maintain the codebase.

Support Continuous Integration: Automated unit tests are often part of CI/CD pipelines to 
ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

Developers: Typically, the developer who writes the code is responsible for writing its 
corresponding unit tests. This ensures that the logic they implemented works as intended.

QA Engineers: In some teams, QA engineers with coding expertise might write additional unit 
tests to verify edge cases or unusual scenarios.

Collaborative Teams: In Agile or DevOps environments, writing unit tests may be a shared 
responsibility to maintain code quality and ensure coverage.

Several libraries and frameworks are available for unit testing JavaScript applications. 
Some of the most commonly used ones include:

1. Jest

Developed by Facebook.
Supports unit, integration, and snapshot testing.
Excellent for React and other JavaScript frameworks.
Built-in mocking and test runner.

2. Mocha

Flexible and widely used JavaScript testing framework.
Requires additional libraries (e.g., Chai for assertions, Sinon for mocking).
Ideal for both browser and Node.js environments.

3. Jasmine

Behavior-driven development (BDD) framework.
Provides a simple syntax for writing test cases.
Includes built-in spies, mocks, and assertions.

4. QUnit

Developed by the jQuery Foundation.
Lightweight and straightforward to use.
Primarily used for testing JavaScript in web applications.
Assertion Libraries

5. Chai
Often used with Mocha.
Provides a variety of assertion styles, including "should," "expect," and "assert."
Mocking and Stubbing Libraries

6. Sinon
Provides spies, stubs, and mocks for testing.
Works well with Mocha and Jasmine.
End-to-End Testing Libraries

7. Cypress

Primarily for E2E testing but can complement unit testing in integration scenarios.
Interactive test runner with excellent debugging tools.

8. Puppeteer

Used for headless browser testing.
Can be adapted for unit testing components requiring a browser environment.
