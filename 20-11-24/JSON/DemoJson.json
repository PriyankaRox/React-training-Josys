// JSON Server is a lightweight and easy-to-use mock REST API that allows developers to create and manage a fake API for prototyping or development purposes. It runs locally and serves data from a JSON file, making it an excellent tool for simulating back-end functionality in front-end development.

// Key Features:

// Provides a RESTful API with minimal setup.
// Supports HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
// Useful for prototyping and testing applications without needing a real back-end.
// Allows custom routes and middleware.
